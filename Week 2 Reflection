The second week of CT20 was really interesting because I got introduced to new functions and variables.
The activities we did in class, such as experimenting with images, and working with the torus() function really helped me to get a better understanding of how visuals work in p5js.
While I was experimenting with images in p5js, I had some trouble getting my image to actually show up when I ran the code, but after a few attempts, I was able to fix the issue.
I also got introduced to some time-based functions and variables, such as millis() and theTime.
I found the time-based function quite helpful because I can use them for my clock project.
I'm not sure if I feel fully ready to do a whole project yet to be honest.
I'm looking forward to learning more cool functions and variables.
